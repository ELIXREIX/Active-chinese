# Fix Google Sheets API Integration

## Current Issue
You provided a Google Cloud Client ID, but we need an API Key for the Google Sheets API.

**Your Client ID:** `722638703449-079plnlhpr1pn2h9ctrcmg0hlohr32mv.apps.googleusercontent.com`
**What we need:** A Google Sheets API Key (starts with `AIza...`)

## Steps to Get the Correct API Key

### 1. Go to Google Cloud Console
Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/

### 2. Select Your Project
- Find the project that has the Client ID: `722638703449-079plnlhpr1pn2h9ctrcmg0hlohr32mv`
- Or create a new project if needed

### 3. Enable Google Sheets API
1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
2. Search for "Google Sheets API"
3. Click on it and press "Enable"

### 4. Create an API Key
1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "API Key"
3. Copy the new API Key (it will look like: `AIzaSy...` - about 39 characters)

### 5. Restrict the API Key (Optional but Recommended)
1. Click on your new API Key
2. Under "API restrictions", select "Restrict key"
3. Check only "Google Sheets API"
4. Save

## Next Steps After Getting the API Key

1. Update your `.env` file with the new API Key
2. Make sure your Google Sheet is publicly accessible
3. Test the connection

## Alternative: Use the Client ID for OAuth (More Complex)
If you prefer to use OAuth with your Client ID, we would need to:
1. Install Google OAuth libraries
2. Implement authentication flow
3. Handle tokens and refresh tokens

The API Key approach is simpler and recommended for this use case.
